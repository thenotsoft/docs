# Middleware

Yii works with HTTP using abstraction layer built around [PSR-7 HTTP message interfaces](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-7/)
and [PSR-15 request handler/middleware interfaces](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-15/).

The application is composed from one or several middleware. When the URL is requested, the request object is passed to
the middleware dispatcher that executes middleware from the stack one by one. Each middleware, given the request, can
either return a response or pass execution to the next middleware.

Depending on how stack is configured, application behavior may vary significantly.

## Using third party middleware

Any PSR-15 compatible middleware could be used with Yii and there are many. Say, we need to add basic authentication
one of the application URLs. URL-dependent middeware are configured using router so we need to modify router factory. 

Authentication middleware is implemented by `middlewares/http-authentication` package so execute
`composer require middlewares/http-authentication` in the application root directory.

Now register the middleware in DI container configuration `config/web.php`:

```php
<?php
\Middlewares\BasicAuthentication::class => [
    '__class' => \Middlewares\BasicAuthentication::class,
    '__construct()' => [
        'users' => [
            'foo' => 'bar',
        ],
    ],
    'realm()' => ['Access to the staging site via basic auth'],
    'attribute()' => ['username'],
],
```

In the router factory, `src/Factory/AppRouterFactory.php` modify the route:

```php
<?php
// ...
class AppRouterFactory
{
    public function __invoke(ContainerInterface $container)
    {
         $basicAuth = $container->get(\Middlewares\BasicAuthentication::class);
         $authorizedAction = new Controller(SiteController::class, 'auth', $container);
         
         $routes = [
            // ...
            Route::get('/basic-auth')->to(new Chain($basicAuth, $authorizedAction)),
        ];
        
        return (new RouterFactory(new FastRouteFactory(), $routes))($container);
    }
}
```

In the above when configuring routing, we are binding `/basic-auth` URL to a chain of middeware consisting of basic
authentication and the action itself. A chain is a special middleware that executes all the middleware it is configured
with.

The action itself may be the following:

```php
public function auth(ServerRequestInterface $request): ResponseInterface
{
    $response = $this->responseFactory->createResponse();
    $response->getBody()->write('Hi ' . $request->getAttribute('username'));
    return $response;
}
```

Basic authentication middleware wrote to request `username` attribute so we can access the data if needed.
